## Details

The algorithm is specifically *fast* and *capable* of working with polygons of all types: multipolygons (without cascading),
polygons with holes, self-intersecting polygons and degenerate polygons with overlapping edges.

### Example

Play with it by [forking this Codepen](http://codepen.io/w8r/pen/rrBkER)

```js
import * as martinez from 'martinez-polygon-clipping';
const gj1 = { "type": "Feature", ..., "geometry": { "type": "Polygon", "coordinates": [ [ [x, y], ... ] ]};
const gj2 = { "type": "Feature", ..., "geometry": { "type": "MultiPolygon", "coordinates": [ [ [ [x, y], ...] ] ]};

const intersection = {
  "type": "Feature",
  "properties": { ... },
  "geometry": {
    "type": "Polygon",
    "coordinates": martinez.intersection(gj1.geometry.coordinates, gj2.geometry.coordinates)
  }
};
```

### API

* **`.intersection(<Geometry>, <Geometry>) => <Geometry>`**
* **`.union(<Geometry>, <Geometry>)        => <Geometry>`**
* **`.diff(<Geometry>, <Geometry>)         => <Geometry>`**
* **`.xor(<Geometry>, <Geometry>)          => <Geometry>`**

`<Geometry>` is [GeoJSON](http://geojson.org/geojson-spec.html) [`'Polygon'`](http://geojson.org/geojson-spec.html#id4) or [`'MultiPolygon'`](http://geojson.org/geojson-spec.html#id7) <u>**coordinates**</u> structure.
`<Operation>` is an enum of `{ INTERSECTION: 0, UNION: 1, DIFFERENCE: 2, XOR: 3 }` in case you have to decide programmatically
which operation do you need

### Benchmarks

```

### Features

The algorithm of Martinez et al. was extended to work with multipolygons without cascading.
